            </a><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Insertion sort </strong></b><span> is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group. </span></p>

</blockquote><p dir="ltr"><b><strong> Q2. What is the Algorithmic Paradigm of the Insertion Sort algorithm? </strong></b></p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span> The Insertion Sort algorithm follows an incremental approach. </span></p>
</blockquote><p dir="ltr"><b><strong> Q3. Is Insertion Sort an in-place sorting algorithm? </strong></b></p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span> Yes, insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. </span></p>
</blockquote><p dir="ltr"><b><strong> Q4. Is Insertion Sort a stable algorithm? </strong></b></p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span> Yes, insertion sort is a stable sorting algorithm. </span></p>
</blockquote><p dir="ltr"><b><strong> Q5. When is the Insertion Sort algorithm used? </strong></b></p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span> Insertion sort is used when number of elements is small. It can also be useful when the input array is almost sorted, and only a few elements are misplaced in a complete big array. </span></p>
