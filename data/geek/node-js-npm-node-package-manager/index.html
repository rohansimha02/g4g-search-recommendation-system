<h2 id="what-is-npm"><span>What is NPM?</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to easily install, manage, and share reusable code, known as packages, for their Node.js projects. NPM plays an important role in simplifying the development process by providing a vast repository of open-source packages, which developers can integrate into their projects with minimal effort.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>NPM gets installed into the system with the installation of Node. The required packages and modules in the Node project are installed using NPM. A package contains all the files needed for a module and modules are the JavaScript libraries that can be included in a Node project according to the requirement of the project. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>NPM can install all the dependencies of a project through the </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-package-json/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>package.json</span></a><span> file. It can also update and uninstall packages. In the package.json file, each dependency can specify a range of valid versions using the semantic versioning scheme, allowing developers to auto-update their packages while at the same time avoiding unwanted breaking changes.  </span></p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-npm"><span>Key Features of NPM</span></h3>
<ul>
<li value="1"><b><strong>Package Installation:</strong></b><span> NPM allows users to quickly install packages (libraries or tools) by simply using the command npm install &lt;package-name&gt;.</span></li>
<li value="2"><b><strong>Dependency Management: </strong></b><span>It handles the installation of all dependencies required by your project, ensuring your application runs smoothly without version conflicts.</span></li>
<li value="3"><b><strong>Version Control:</strong></b><span> NPM helps manage different versions of packages and ensures that your project uses the correct versions of dependencies.</span></li>
<li value="4"><b><strong>Scripts:</strong></b><span> With NPM, developers can automate tasks such as testing, building, and running code by defining custom scripts in the package.json file.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-facts-about-npm"><b><strong>Some facts about NPM</strong></b></h2>
<ul>
<li value="1"><span>At the time of writing this article, NPM has 580096 registered packages. The average rate of growth of this number is 291/day which outraces every other package registry.</span></li>
<li value="2"><span>npm is open source</span></li>
<li value="3"><span>The top npm packages in the decreasing order are: lodash, async, react, request, express.</span></li>
