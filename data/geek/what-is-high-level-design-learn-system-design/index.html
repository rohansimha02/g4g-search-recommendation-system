<h2 id="what-is-highlevel-design"><span>What is High-Level Design?</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>High-Level Design is a initial step in development of applications where overall structure of a system is planned. High-Level design focuses mainly on how different components of the system work together without getting to know about internal coding and implementation. This helps everyone involving in the project to understand the goals and ensures good communication during development.</span></p>

<h2 id="components-of-highlevel-design"><span>Components of High-Level Design</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Understanding the components of high-level design is very important for creating effective systems that meets user needs and technical requirements. Below are the main components of high-level design:</span></p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><b><strong>System Architecture: </strong></b><span>System architecture is an overview of the entire system which represents the structure and the relationships between various components. It helps to visually represent how different parts interact and function.</span></li>
<li value="2"><b><strong>Modules and Components</strong></b><span>: High-Level design breaks down the systems into modules or components each with specific roles and responsibilities, and has a distinct function that contributes to entire system helping in developing an efficient system.</span></li>
<li value="3"><b><strong>Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)</strong></b><span>: Data Flow Diagrams demonstrates the data movement within the system. They help to understand how information is processed and handled. </span></li>
<li value="4"><b><strong>Interface Design</strong></b><span>: This component focuses on how different modules communicate with one another. It details the application programming interfaces (APIs) and user interfaces necessary for seamless interaction between components. </span></li>
<li value="5"><b><strong>Technology Stack</strong></b><span>: The technology stack are various technologies and tools that will be used in the development of the system. This includes programming languages, frameworks, databases. </span></li>
<li value="6"><b><strong>Deployment Architecture</strong></b><span>: It includes how the system will be hosted and accessed. It includes server configurations, cloud infrastructure, and network considerations.</span></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="purpose-and-characteristics-of-highlevel-design"><b><strong>Purpose and Characteristics of High-Level Design</strong></b></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>The purpose of this High-Level Design (HLD) is to add the necessary detailed description to represent a suitable model. This is designed to help with operational requirements and will help to understand how the modules interact.&nbsp;Basically, HLD is a technical representation of functional requirements and the flow of information across components.</span><b><strong> </strong></b><span>Characteristics of High-Level Design include:</span></p><div id="GFG_AD_Desktop_InContent_ATF_336x280" style="text-align:center; max-height: 280px;"></div><div id="GFG_AD_gfg_mobile_336x280_1" style="margin: 5px 0;"></div>
<ul>
<li value="1"><span>A diagram representing each design aspect is included in the HLD (which is based on business requirements and anticipated results).</span></li>
<li value="2"><span>Description of hardware, software interfaces, and also user interfaces.</span></li>
<li value="3"><span>The workflow of the user&#8217;s typical process is detailed, along with performance specifications.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-hld-is-different-from-lld"><b><strong>How HLD is different from LLD</strong></b></h2>
<p><span>High Level Design or HLD is a general system design where we do tradeoffs between different frameworks, components, and different databases and we choose the best considering what the business needs and how the system should work, both in terms of functional and non functional aspects. </span></p><div id="_GFG_ABP_Incontent_728x90" style="text-align:center;"></div>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Whereas LLD(Low Level Design), translates the HLD into smaller and more specific details, It includes class diagrams, methods, data structures, and algorithms, focusing on how each part will be implemented. It is Primarily used by developers and technical teams.</span></p>

<h3 id="1-capacity-estimation"><b><strong>1. </strong></b><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/capacity-estimation-in-systems-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><strong>Capacity Estimation</strong></b></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Capacity estimation in system design involves predicting the resources (such as processing power, memory, and bandwidth) required to meet the expected workload. It ensures that a system can handle current and future demands efficiently, helping in the proper allocation of resources and preventing performance bottlenecks. </span></p><div style="text-align:center;margin:20px 0; max-height: 280px;" id="GFG_AD_gfg_outstream_incontent"></div>
<p dir="ltr"><b><strong>For example:</strong></b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol), is used to transfer the data over the web, which enables the communication between clients and server, that helps user to requests resources like HTML pages, messages, videos or images while HTTPS(HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP which adds a extra layer of security through SSL/TLS encryption. Methods of HTTP include GET, PUT and POST.</span></p>

<h3 id="3-web-sockets"><b><strong>3. </strong></b><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/websockets-in-microservices-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><strong>Web Sockets</strong></b></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>There are two way to send data from server to clients which are websockets and polling. In a </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/client-server-model/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>client-server architecture</span></a><span>, we are sending a request to server and server sends it back and so in this way communication takes place. But in designing the system biggest problem we face is whether we can implement the client-server model because we can not wait until the server responds. </span></p>
<ul>
<li value="1"><span>Here Web Sockets play a crucial role that solving problems and enabling us to have real-time communication. </span></li>
<li value="2"><span>WebSocket is a full-duplex protocol as it allows the application to send and receive data at the same time.</span></li>
<li value="3"><span>They are more or less used in every system to be designed because we can not let our system wait for a response. </span></li>
<li value="4"><span>They are very useful in Real-time web applications, gaming applications, chat applications. </span></li>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Another way of sending and receiving data from a server just likely as we do we doing above in the case of web sockets Polling. There are mainly 2 types of polling:</span></p>
<ul>
<li value="1"><b><strong>In short polling</strong></b><span>, we sent the request.&nbsp;In short polling, the client sends a request to the server and the server immediately sends data at fixed intervals whether the data is updated or not. </span></li>

<p dir="ltr"><span>It is purposely built as one-way communication from servers to clients in specific design systems. SSE is a technology that helps to push real-time updates from the server to the clients over HTTP connection. SSE enables server to send data automatically as it becomes available.</span><b><strong> </strong></b><span>Example of SSE include real-time streaming.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>A rate limiter restricts the number of events that can be done in a timeframe by restricting the number of requests a sender can send in a given period of time. Here once the threshold limit is reached now further it blocks the incoming requests as can be seen below media as follows:</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>No matter how great a system we design there is always a chance of faults and failure which could be because of hardware issues or software issues(such as running low on memory) or there can be some human error. In such cases we need to provide resiliency through replication, redundancy and availability.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Note:</strong></b><span> System design interviews starts with open ended designing a specific system which later is bounded with constraints at multiple levels. In order to clear dealing with these bounds in layman language is known as resiliency via implementing common tradeoff in the system. Hence providing resiliency is very crucial in designing complex system designs and also in clearing interviews.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>A log file records details of events occurring in a software application. The details may consist of microservices, transactions, service actions, or anything helpful to debug the flow of an event in the system. Logging is crucial to monitor the application&#8217;s flow. This can also be useful for tracking the health and performance of a distributed system, as well as for debugging issues that may arise.
