Unlike a framework, React’s library approach allows it to evolve into a remarkable tool. </span></p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Second, React has a great developer experience, making it easier to understand and write code. Third, it benefits from Facebook’s support and resources, ensuring regular bug fixes, enhancements, and documentation updates. Additionally, React’s broader community support, excellent performance, and ease of testing make it an ideal choice for web development.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>One of the most effective ways to solidify your understanding is through practical application. That's where structured learning comes into play. For those looking to deepen their React skills and progress from beginner to advanced levels, consider enrolling in the course on </span><a href="https://gfgcdn.com/tu/St7/" target="_blank" rel=""><span>React JS: Beginner to Advanced</span></a><span> offered by GeeksforGeeks. This comprehensive course provides hands-on projects and real-world applications, making it an excellent resource for anyone serious about mastering React.</span></p><h2 id="features-of-react"><span>Features of React</span></h2><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>1. JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension)</strong></b><span>:</span></p><ul><li value="1"><span>JSX combines HTML and JavaScript, allowing you to embed JavaScript objects within HTML elements.</span></li><li value="2"><span>It enhances code readability and simplifies UI development.</span><b><strong> </strong></b></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Example</strong></b><span>:</span></p><pre><span>const name = "GeekforGeeks";
const ele = &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to {name}&lt;/h1&gt;;</span></pre><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>2. Virtual DOM (Document Object Model)</strong></b><span>:</span></p><ul><li value="1"><span>React uses a virtual DOM, which is an exact copy of the real DOM.</span></li><li value="2"><span>When there are modifications in the web application, React updates the virtual DOM first and then computes the differences between the real DOM and the virtual DOM.</span></li><li value="3"><span>This approach minimizes unnecessary re-rendering and improves performance.</span></li></ul><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230725135348/Browser-DOM-Virtual-DOM-React.webp" alt="Browser-DOM-Virtual-DOM-React" width="inherit" height="inherit" loading="lazy"><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>3. One-way Data Binding</strong></b><span>:</span></p><ul><li value="1"><span>React follows one-way data binding, where data flows from parent components to child components.</span></li><li value="2"><span>Child components cannot directly return data to their parent components, but they can communicate with parents to modify states based on provided inputs.</span></li></ul><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240118103527/oneway-300x243.jpg" alt="react data binding" width="inherit" height="inherit" loading="lazy"><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>4. Performance</strong></b><span>:</span></p><ul><li value="1"><span>React’s virtual DOM and component-based architecture contribute to better performance.</span></li><li value="2"><span>Separate components allow efficient rendering and faster execution.</span></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>5. Extension</strong></b><span>:</span></p><ul><li value="1"><span>React has a rich ecosystem and supports various extensions.</span></li><li value="2"><span>Explore tools like&nbsp;</span><b><strong>Flux</strong></b><span>,&nbsp;</span><b><strong>Redux</strong></b><span>, and&nbsp;</span><b><strong>React Native</strong></b><span>&nbsp;for mobile app development and server-side rendering.</span></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>6. Conditional Statements in JSX</strong></b><span>:</span></p><ul><li value="1"><span>JSX allows writing conditional statements directly.</span></li><li value="2"><span>Display data in the browser based on provided conditions.</span></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Example</strong></b><span>:</span></p><pre><span>const age = 12;
if (age &gt;= 10) {
  return &lt;p&gt;Greater than {age}&lt;/p&gt;;
} else {
  return &lt;p&gt;{age}&lt;/p&gt;;
}</span></pre><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>7. Components</strong></b><span>:</span></p><ul><li value="1"><span>React divides web pages into reusable and immutable components.</span></li><li value="2"><span>Component-based development simplifies code organization and maintenance.</span></li></ul><h2 id="core-react-concepts"><span>Core React Concepts </span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>here are some essential concepts to learn:</span></p><ul><li value="1"><b><strong>Props:</strong></b><span> Components can receive data from parent components through props, enabling you to pass information and customize component behavior.</span></li><li value="2"><b><strong>State:</strong></b><span> Components can manage their internal state using the </span><code><span>useState</span></code><span> hook. This state dictates the component's appearance and behavior, and updates trigger re-renders.</span></li><li value="3"><b><strong>Lifecycle Methods:</strong></b><span> React provides lifecycle methods like </span><code><span>componentDidMount</span></code><span> and </span><code><span>componentDidUpdate</span></code><span> that allow you to perform actions at specific stages of a component's lifecycle.</span></li><li value="4"><b><strong>Conditional Rendering:</strong></b><span>  Control what gets displayed on the screen based on certain conditions using conditional statements within JSX.</span></li></ul><h2 id="react-advantages"><b><strong>React Advantages</strong></b></h2><ul><li value="1"><b><strong>Composable:</strong></b><span> We can divide these codes and put them in custom components. Then we can utilize those components and integrate them into one place.</span></li><li value="2"><b><strong>Declarative:</strong></b><span> In ReactJS, the DOM is declarative. We can make interactive UIs by changing the state of the component and ReactJS takes care of updating the DOM according to it.</span></li><li value="3"><b><strong>SEO Friendly:</strong></b><span> ReactJS affects the SEO by giving you a SPA (Single Page Application) which requires Javascript to show the content on the page which can be rendered and indexed.</span></li><li value="4"><b><strong>Community:</strong></b><span> ReactJS has a huge community because of its demand each company wants to work with ReactJS. Companies like Meta, Netflix, etc built on ReactJS.</span></li><li value="5"><b><strong>Easy to learn:</strong></b><span> HTML-like syntax of JSX makes you comfortable with the codes of React, it only requires a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS fundamentals to start working with it.</span></li><li value="6"><span>If you want to learn more refer to this article </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-the-advantages-of-react-js" rel="noopener"><span>React JS Advantages</span></a></li><li value="7"><b><strong>Debugging is Easy:</strong></b><span> The debugging of ReactJS is unidirectional which means while designing any app using ReactJS the child components are nested within parent components. So, the data flow is in a single direction it gets more easier to debug errors.</span></li></ul><h2 id="react-tutorial"><span>React Tutorial</span></h2><h3 id="react-basic-concepts"><span>React Basic
