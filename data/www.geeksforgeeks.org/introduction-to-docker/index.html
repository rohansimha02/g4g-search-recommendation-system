All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than a virtual machine. </span></p>

<h2 id="why-docker-is-popular"><span> Why Docker is popular? </span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span> Docker gained its popularity due to its impact on the software development and deployment. The following are the some of the main reasons for docker becoming popular: </span></p>

<h2 id="what-is-docker-architecture-and-how-docker-works"><span> What is Docker Architecture and How Docker Works? </span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span> Docker makes use of a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks with the docker daemon which helps in building, running, and distributing the docker containers. The Docker client runs with the daemon on the same system or we can connect the Docker client with the Docker daemon remotely. With the help of REST API over a UNIX socket or a network, the docker client and daemon interact with each other. To know more about working of docker refer to the </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/architecture-of-docker" rel="noopener"><span> Architecture of Docker </span></a><span> . </span></p>

<h2 id="what-is-docker-image"><span> What is Docker Image? </span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span> It is a file, comprised of multiple layers, used to execute code in a Docker container. They are a set of instructions used to create docker containers. Docker Image is an executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. This image informs how a container should instantiate, determining which software components will run and how. Docker Container is a virtual environment that bundles application code with all the dependencies required to run the application. The application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. </span></p>
<h2 id="what-is-docker-container"><span> What is Docker Container? </span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span> Docker container is a runtime instance of an image. Allows developers to package applications with all parts needed such as libraries and other dependencies. Docker Containers are runtime instances of Docker images. Containers contain the whole kit required for an application, so the application can be run in an isolated way. For eg.- Suppose there is an image of Ubuntu OS with NGINX SERVER when this image is run with the docker run command, then a container will be created and NGINX SERVER will be running on Ubuntu OS. </span></p><div style="text-align:center;margin:20px 0; max-height: 280px;" id="GFG_AD_gfg_outstream_incontent"></div>
<h2 id="what-is-docker-hub"><span> What is Docker Hub? </span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span> Docker Hub is a repository service and it is a cloud-based service where people push their Docker Container Images and also pull the Docker Container Images from the Docker Hub anytime or anywhere via the internet. Generally it makes it easy to find and reuse images. It provides features such as you can push your images as private or public registry where you can store and share Docker images. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span> Mainly DevOps team uses the Docker Hub. It is an open-source tool and freely available for all operating systems. It is like storage where we store the images and pull the images when it is required. When a person wants to push/pull images from the Docker Hub they must have a basic knowledge of Docker. Let us discuss the requirements of the Docker tool. </span></p>

The YAML file consists of all configurations needed to deploy containers </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-docker-compose/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span> Docker Compose </span></a><span> , which is integrated with </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-docker-swarm-mode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span> Docker Swarm </span></a><span> , and provides directions for building and deploying containers. With Docker Compose, each container is constructed to run on a single host. </span></p>

<h2 id="docker-commands"><span> Docker Commands </span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span> Through introducing the essential docker commands, docker became a powerful software in streamlining the container management process. It helps in ensuring a seamless development and deployment workflows. The following are the some of docker commands that are used commonly: </span></p>
<ul><li value="1"><b><strong> Docker Run: </strong></b><span> It used for launching the containers from images, with specifying the runtime options and commands. </span></li><li value="2"><b><strong> Docker Pull: </strong></b><span> It fetches the container images from the container registry like Docker Hub to the local machine. </span></li><li value="3"><b><strong> Docker ps </strong></b><span> : It helps in displaying the running containers along with their important information like container ID, image used and status. </span></li><li value="4"><b><strong> Docker Stop </strong></b><span> : It helps in halting the running containers gracefully shutting down the processes within them. </span></li><li value="5"><b><strong> Docker Start: </strong></b><span> It helps in restarting the stopped containers, resuming their operations from the previous state. </span></li><li value="6"><b><strong> Docker Login: </strong></b><span> It helps to login in to the docker registry enabling the access to private repositories. </span></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><span> To Know more about the docker commands refer tot the </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/docker-instruction-commands" rel="noopener"><span> Docker – Instruction Commands </span></a><span> . </span></p>
<h2 id="dockerengine"><span> Docker Engine </span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span> The software that hosts the containers is named Docker Engine. Docker Engine is a client-server based application. The docker engine has 3 main components: </span></p>
<ol><li value="1"><b><strong> Server: </strong></b><span> It is responsible for creating and managing Docker images, containers, networks, and volumes on the Docker. It is referred to as a daemon process. </span></li><li value="2"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rest-api-introduction/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><b><strong> REST API </strong></b></a><b><strong> : </strong></b><span> It specifies how the applications can interact with the Server and instructs it what to do. </span></li><li value="3"><b><strong> Client: </strong></b><span> The Client is a docker command-line interface (CLI), that allows us to interact with Docker using the docker commands. </span></li></ol><h2 id="why-to-use-docker"><span> Why to use Docker? </span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span> Docker can be used to pack the application and its dependencies which makes it lightweight and easy to ship the code faster with more reliability. Docker make its very simple to run the application in the production environment docker container can be platform independent if the docker engine is installed in the machine. </span></p>
<ul><li value="1"><b><strong> Resource Efficiency </strong></b><span> : Docker helps in maximizing the resource utilization by running the multiple containers on a single host. It helps in reducing the infrastructure costs and improves the efficiency. </span></li><li value="2"><b><strong> Version Control: </strong></b><span> It simples the versioning for the applications and their dependencies ensuring the consistency and making easier of collaboration across the teams. </span></li><li value="3"><b><strong> Microservices Agility: </strong></b><span> It enables the adoption of microservices architecture, promoting the scalability, flexibility and fault isolation agile application development. </span></li></ul><h2 id="what-is-docker-for-aws"><span> What is Docker For AWS? </span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span> Docker is the most powerful tool to run the application in the form of containers.

<h2 id="conclusion"><span> Conclusion </span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span> So you have learned about the basics of Docker, the difference between Virtual Machines and Docker Containers along some common terminologies in Docker. Also, we went through the installation of Docker on our systems. We created an application using Docker and pushed our image to Docker Hub. Lastly, we learned how we could remove a particular image from our local system and later pull the image from Docker Hub if it doesn&#8217;t exist locally. </span></p>
