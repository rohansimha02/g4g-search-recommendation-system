<h2><span>Constructors and Destructors in Inheritance</span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>Constructors and Destructors are generally defined by the programmer and if not, the compiler automatically creates them so they are present in every class in C++. Now, the question arises what happens to the constructor and destructor when a class is inherited by another class.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In C++ inheritance, the </span><b><strong>constructors and destructors are not inherited by the derived class,</strong></b><span> but we can call the constructor of the base class in derived class.</span></p>
<ul><li value="1"><span>The constructors will be called by the complier in the order in which they are inherited. It means that base class constructors will be called first, then derived class constructors will be called.</span></li><li value="2"><span>The destructors will be called in reverse order in which the compiler is declared.</span></li><li value="3"><span>We can also call the constructors and destructors manually in the derived class.</span></li></ul><h3><span>Example</span></h3><gfg-tabs data-run-ide="true" data-mode="light">

<h2><span>Polymorphism in Inheritance</span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>In Inheritance, we can redefine the base class member function in the derived class. This type of inheritance is called Function Overriding. Generally, in other programming languages, function overriding is runtime polymorphism but in C++, we can do it at both runtime and complile time. For runtime polymorphism, we have to use the virtual functions.</span></p>

<h2><span>Frequently Asked Questions on C++ Inheritance</span></h2><h3><span>Can the derived class inherit static members?</span></h3><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span>Yes, a derived class can inherit&nbsp;static members&nbsp;(such as static variables or static functions) from the base class.&nbsp;However, these members are shared across all instances of the derived class.</span></p>
</blockquote><h3><span>What are a base class and a derived class?</span></h3><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span>A base class (also called a superclass) is an existing class from which other classes inherit properties and methods. A derived class (also called a subclass) is a new class created by inheriting from the base class.</span></p>
</blockquote><h3><span>What are the rules for calling a base class constructor in a derived class?</span></h3><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span>The base class constructor can be explicitly called in the initializer list of the derived class constructor. If not specified, the default constructor of the base class is called automatically. If the base class does not have a default constructor, the derived class must explicitly call one of the base class&#8217;s constructors.</span></p>
