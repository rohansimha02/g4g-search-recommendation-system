It is started from two distinct estimates x<sub>a</sub> and x<sub>b</sub> for the root. It is an iterative procedure involving linear interpolation to a root. The iteration stops if f(x<sub>b</sub>) is very small and then x<sub>b</sub> is the solution. The procedure is given below. Observe that there is an expression which is missing and is marked by? Which is the suitable expression that is to be put in place of? So that it follows all steps of the secant method?

The function treats the first element of a[] as a pivot, and rearranges the array so that all elements less than or equal to the pivot is in the left part of the array, and all elements greater than the pivot is in the right part. In addition, it moves the pivot so that the pivot is the last element of the left part. The return value is the number of elements in the left part. The following partially given function in the C programming language is used to find the kth smallest element in an array a[ ] of size n using the partition function. We assume k ≤ n
