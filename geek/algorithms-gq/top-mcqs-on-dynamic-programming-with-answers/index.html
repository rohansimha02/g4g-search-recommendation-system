Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and using the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem. In this case, the algorithm breaks down the problem of finding the longest monotonically increasing sequence into subproblems of finding the longest monotonically increasing sequence starting at each index in the array. The algorithm then uses the solutions to these subproblems to find the solution to the original problem.Here is the mathematical explanation:Let L[i] denote the length of the longest monotonically increasing sequence starting at index i in the array A[0:n - 1]. Then, the algorithm can be written as follows:L[n - 1] = 1for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):L[i] = 1 if A[i] \u0026amp;gt;= A[i + 1] else 1 + L[i + 1]Hence Option(A) is correct.\"},\"encodingFormat\":\"text/plain\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"eduQuestionType\":\"Multiple choice\",\"learningResourceType\":\"Practice problem\",\"name\":\"Question on Top MCQs on Dynamic Programming with Answers\",\"text\":\"Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of dynamic programming?\",\"encodingFormat\":\"text/HTML\",\"suggestedAnswer\":[{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"position\":1,\"text\":\"Memoization, which involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them.\",\"comment\":{\"@type\":\"Comment\",\"text\":\"This is not the correct answer\"},\"encodingFormat\":\"text/plain\"},{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"position\":2,\"text\":\"Breaking a problem into smaller overlapping subproblems.\",\"comment\":{\"@type\":\"Comment\",\"text\":\"This is not the correct answer\"},\"encodingFormat\":\"text/plain\"},{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"position\":4,\"text\":\"Dynamic programming can be used for problems where the solution has an optimal substructure.\",\"comment\":{\"@type\":\"Comment\",\"text\":\"This is not the correct answer\"},\"encodingFormat\":\"text/plain\"}],\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"position\":3,\"text\":\"Solving problems in a sequential manner.\",\"comment\":{\"@type\":\"Comment\",\"text\":\"The correct answer is Solving problems in a sequential manner.\"},\"answerExplanation\":{\"@type\":\"Comment\",\"text\":\"Option (A): In dynamic programming Break down the given problem in order to begin solving it.
