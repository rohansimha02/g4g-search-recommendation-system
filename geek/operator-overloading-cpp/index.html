<h2><span>C++ Operator Overloading</span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>C++ has the ability to provide the operators with a special meaning for a data type, this ability is known as operator overloading. Operator overloading is a compile-time polymorphism. For example, we can overload an operator &#8216;+&#8217; in a class like String so that we can concatenate two strings by just using +. Other example classes where arithmetic operators may be overloaded are Complex Numbers, Fractional Numbers, Big integers, etc.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Example:</strong></b></p>
<p class="katexPreClass"><span>int a;</span><br><span>float b,sum;</span><br><span>sum = a + b;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Here, variables “a” and “b” are of types “int” and “float”, which are built-in data types. Hence the addition operator ‘+’ can easily add the contents of “a” and “b”. This is because the addition operator “+” is predefined to add variables of built-in data type only.&nbsp;</span></p>

</gfg-panel></gfg-tabs><p dir="ltr"><span>To fully master operator overloading and other advanced OOP techniques, our </span><a href="https://gfgcdn.com/tu/T5l/" target="_new" rel="noopener"><span>Complete C++ Course</span></a><span> provides detailed tutorials with practical examples.</span></p><div id="GFG_AD_Desktop_InContent_ATF_336x280" style="text-align:center; max-height: 280px;"></div><div id="GFG_AD_gfg_mobile_336x280_1" style="margin: 5px 0;"></div>
<p dir="ltr"><br><span>In this example, we have 3 variables “a1”, “a2” and “a3” of type “class A”. Here we are trying to add two objects “a1” and “a2”, which are of user-defined type i.e. of type “class A” using the “+” operator. This is not allowed, because the addition operator “+” is predefined to operate only on built-in data types. But here, “class A” is a user-defined type, so the compiler generates an error. This is where the concept of “Operator overloading” comes in.</span></p><div id="_GFG_ABP_Incontent_728x90" style="text-align:center;"></div>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Now, if the user wants to make the operator “+” add two class objects, the user has to redefine the meaning of the “+” operator such that it adds two class objects. This is done by using the concept of “Operator overloading”. So the main idea behind “Operator overloading” is to use C++ operators with class variables or class objects. Redefining the meaning of operators really does not change their original meaning; instead, they have been given additional meaning along with their existing ones.</span></p>

This is evaluated by the compiler and cannot be evaluated during runtime. The proper incrementing of a pointer in an array of objects relies on the sizeof operator implicitly. Altering its meaning using overloading would cause a fundamental part of the language to collapse.</span></p>
<h3><b><strong>2. typeid Operator</strong></b></h3><p dir="ltr"><span>This provides a CPP program with the ability to recover the actually derived type of the object referred to by a pointer or reference. For this operator, the whole point is to uniquely identify a type. If we want to make a user-defined type &#8216;look&#8217; like another type, polymorphism can be used but the meaning of the typeid operator must remain unaltered, or else serious issues could arise.</span></p>
<h3><b><strong>3. Scope resolution (::) Operator</strong></b></h3><p dir="ltr"><span>This helps identify and specify the context to which an identifier refers by specifying a namespace. It is completely evaluated at runtime and works on names rather than values. The operands of scope resolution are note expressions with data types and CPP has no syntax for capturing them if it were overloaded. So it is syntactically impossible to overload this operator.</span></p>
<h3><b><strong>4. Class member access operators (.(dot</strong></b><span>), .* (pointer to member operator))</span></h3><p dir="ltr"><span>The importance and implicit use of class member access operators can be understood through the following example:</span></p>

</gfg-panel></gfg-tabs><div class="code-output"><br><strong>Output</strong><pre>5 + i9</pre></div><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Explanation:</strong></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The statement ComplexNumber c3 = c1 + c2; is internally translated as ComplexNumber c3 = c1.operator+ (c2); in order to invoke the operator function. The argument c1 is implicitly passed using the </span><b><strong>&#8216;.&#8217;</strong></b><span> operator. The next statement also makes use of the dot operator to access the member function print and pass c3 as an argument.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Besides, these operators also work on names and not values and there is no provision (syntactically) to overload them.</span></p>
<h3><b><strong>5. Ternary or conditional (?:) Operator</strong></b></h3><p dir="ltr"><span>The ternary or conditional operator is a shorthand representation of an if-else statement. In the operator, the true/false expressions are only evaluated on the basis of the truth value of the conditional expression.&nbsp;</span></p><div style="text-align:center;margin:20px 0;max-height:280px" id="GFG_AD_gfg_outstream_incontent-1"></div>
<p class="katexPreClass"><span>conditional statement ? expression1 (if statement is TRUE) : expression2 (else)</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>A function overloading the ternary operator for a class say ABC using the definition</span></p>
<p class="katexPreClass"><span>ABC operator ?: (bool condition, ABC trueExpr, ABC falseExpr);</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>would not be able to guarantee that only one of the expressions was evaluated. Thus, the ternary operator cannot be overloaded.</span></p>
<h2><b><strong>Important Points about Operator Overloading</strong></b><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>1) </strong></b><span>For operator overloading to work, at least one of the operands must be a user-defined class object.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><b><strong>2) Assignment Operator:</strong></b><span> Compiler automatically creates a default assignment operator with every class. The default assignment operator does assign all members of the right side to the left side and works fine in most cases (this behavior is the same as the copy constructor). See </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/assignment-operator-overloading-in-c/" rel="noopener"><span>this</span></a><span> for more details.</span></p>
