<p dir="ltr"><span>There are mainly three steps in the algorithm:</span></p>
<ol><li value="1"><b><strong>Choose a Pivot: </strong></b><span>Select an element from the array as the pivot. The choice of pivot can vary (e.g., first element, last element, random element, or median).</span></li><li value="2"><b><strong>Partition the Array:</strong></b><span> Rearrange the array around the pivot. After partitioning, all elements smaller than the pivot will be on its left, and all elements greater than the pivot will be on its right. The pivot is then in its correct position, and we obtain the index of the pivot.</span></li><li value="3"><b><strong>Recursively Call:</strong></b><span> Recursively apply the same process to the two partitioned sub-arrays (left and right of the pivot).</span></li><li value="4"><b><strong>Base Case:</strong></b><span> The recursion stops when there is only one element left in the sub-array, as a single element is already sorted.</span></li></ol><p dir="ltr"><span>Here’s a basic overview of how the QuickSort algorithm works.</span></p>

<h2 id="illustration-of-quicksort-algorithm"><b><strong>Illustration of QuickSort Algorithm</strong></b></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>In the previous step, we looked at how the</span><b><strong> partitioning </strong></b><span>process rearranges the array based on the chosen </span><b><strong>pivot</strong></b><span>. Next, we apply the same method recursively to the smaller sub-arrays on the </span><b><strong>left </strong></b><span>and </span><b><strong>right</strong></b><span> of the pivot. Each time, we select new pivots and partition the arrays again. This process continues until only one element is left, which is always sorted.

                <div class="gfg-similar-read-item-subheading">QuickSort is a popular sorting technique based on divide and conquer algorithm. In this technique, an element is chosen as a pivot and the array is partitioned around it. The target of partition is, given an array and an element x of the array as a pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x)</div>
