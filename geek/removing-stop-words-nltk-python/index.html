<p dir="ltr"><span>Certain words, like &#8220;the,&#8221; &#8220;and,&#8221; and &#8220;is,&#8221; are thought to be ineffective for communicating important information. The objective of eliminating words that add little or nothing to the comprehension of the text is to expedite text processing, even though the list of stopwords may differ.</span></p>
<h2 id="what-are-stop-words"><b><strong>What are Stop words?</strong></b></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/part-speech-tagging-stop-words-using-nltk-python/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>stop word</span></a><span> is a commonly used word (such as &#8220;the&#8221;, &#8220;a&#8221;, &#8220;an&#8221;, or &#8220;in&#8221;) that a search engine has been programmed to ignore, both when indexing entries for searching and when retrieving them as the result of a search query. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We would not want these words to take up space in our database or take up valuable processing time. For this, we can remove them easily, by storing a list of words that you consider to stop words. </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-nltk-tokenization-stemming-lemmatization-pos-tagging/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>NLTK</span></a><span>(Natural Language Toolkit) in Python has a list of stopwords stored in 16 different languages. You can find them in the nltk_data directory. </span><i><em class="GFGEditorTheme__textItalic">home/Pratima</em></i><b><strong>Python</strong></b><i><em class="GFGEditorTheme__textItalic">/nltk_data/corpora/stopwords</em></i><span> are the directory address. </span><b><strong>or </strong></b><span>(Do not forget to change your home directory name)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><img alt="Stop word removal using NLTK" height="inherit" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Stop-word-removal-using-NLTK.png" width="inherit" /></p>
<h2 id="need-to-remove-the-stopwords"><span>Need to remove the Stopwords </span></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: start"><span>The necessity of removing stopwords in NLP is contingent upon the specific task at hand. For </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rnn-for-text-classifications-in-nlp/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>text classification</span></a><span> tasks, where the objective is to categorize text into distinct groups, excluding stopwords is common practice. This is done to channel more attention towards words that truly convey the essence of the text. As illustrated earlier, certain words like &#8220;there,&#8221; &#8220;book,&#8221; and &#8220;table&#8221; contribute significantly to the text&#8217;s meaning, unlike less informative words such as &#8220;is&#8221; and &#8220;on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: start"><span>Conversely, for tasks like machine translation and text summarization, the removal of stopwords is not recommended. In these scenarios, every word plays a pivotal role in preserving the original meaning of the content. </span></p>
<h2 id="types-of-stopwords"><span>Types of Stopwords </span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Stopwords are frequently occurring words in a language that are frequently omitted from natural language processing (NLP) tasks due to their low significance for deciphering textual meaning. The particular list of stopwords can change based on the language being studied and the context. The following is a broad list of stopword categories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li value="1"><b><strong>Common Stopwords: </strong></b><span>These are the most frequently occurring words in a language and are often removed during text preprocessing. Examples include &#8220;the,&#8221; &#8220;is,&#8221; &#8220;in,&#8221; &#8220;for,&#8221; &#8220;where,&#8221; &#8220;when,&#8221; &#8220;to,&#8221; &#8220;at,&#8221; etc.</span></li>
<li value="2"><b><strong>Custom Stopwords: </strong></b><span>Depending on the specific task or domain, additional words may be considered as stopwords. These could be domain-specific terms that don&#8217;t contribute much to the overall meaning. For example, in a medical context, words like &#8220;patient&#8221; or &#8220;treatment&#8221; might be considered as custom stopwords.</span></li>
<li value="3"><b><strong>Numerical Stopwords: </strong></b><span>Numbers and numeric characters may be treated as stopwords in certain cases, especially when the analysis is focused on the meaning of the text rather than specific numerical values.</span></li>
<li value="4"><b><strong>Single-Character Stopwords: </strong></b><span>Single characters, such as &#8220;a,&#8221; &#8220;I,&#8221; &#8220;s,&#8221; or &#8220;x,&#8221; may be considered stopwords, particularly in cases where they don&#8217;t convey much meaning on their own.</span></li>
<li value="5"><b><strong>Contextual Stopwords: </strong></b><span>Words that are stopwords in one context but meaningful in another may be considered as contextual stopwords. For instance, the word &#8220;will&#8221; might be a stopword in the context of general language processing but could be important in predicting future events.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="checking-english-stopwords-list"><span>Checking English Stopwords List </span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>An English stopwords list typically includes common words that carry little semantic meaning and are often excluded during text analysis. Examples of these words are &#8220;the,&#8221; &#8220;and,&#8221; &#8220;is,&#8221; &#8220;in,&#8221; &#8220;for,&#8221; and &#8220;it.&#8221; These stopwords are frequently removed to focus on more meaningful terms when processing text data in natural language processing tasks such as text classification or sentiment analysis.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><b><strong>To check the list of stopwords you can type the following commands in the python shell.</strong></b><span> </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The provided Python code demonstrates stopword removal using the</span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tokenize-text-using-nltk-python/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span> Natural Language Toolkit</span></a><span> (NLTK) library. In the first step, the sample sentence, which reads &#8220;This is a sample sentence, showing off the stop words filtration,&#8221; is tokenized into words using the </span><code><span>word_tokenize</span></code><span> function. The code then filters out stopwords by converting each word to lowercase and checking its presence in the set of English stopwords obtained from NLTK. The resulting </span><code><span>filtered_sentence</span></code><span> is printed, showcasing both lowercased and original versions, providing a cleaned version of the sentence with common English stopwords removed. </span></p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions"><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
<h3><b><strong>1. What are stopwords in NLP?</strong></b></h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Stopwords are common words in a language that are often filtered out during NLP tasks because they are considered to carry little meaning or contribute minimally to the overall understanding of a text. Examples include &#8220;the,&#8221; &#8220;is,&#8221; &#8220;and,&#8221; &#8220;in,&#8221; etc.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><b><strong>2. Why do we remove stopwords in NLP?</strong></b></h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Stopwords are removed in NLP to focus on the more meaningful and informative words in a text. This is often done to reduce noise, improve efficiency in processing, and highlight keywords that carry the essential meaning of the text.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><b><strong>3. Can the list of stopwords vary between NLP libraries?</strong></b></h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Yes, the list of stopwords can vary between NLP libraries. Different libraries, such as NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, and scikit-learn, may provide their own sets of stopwords. Users can also customize the list based on their specific needs.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><b><strong>4. When should stopwords be retained?</strong></b></h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Stopwords should be retained when they contribute to the context, coherence, or specific linguistic features of the text. Tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and certain sentiment analysis scenarios may benefit from retaining stopwords.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><b><strong>5. What are some common English stopwords?</strong></b></h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Common English stopwords include &#8220;the,&#8221; &#8220;and,&#8221; &#8220;is,&#8221; &#8220;in,&#8221; &#8220;for,&#8221; &#8220;where,&#8221; &#8220;when,&#8221; &#8220;to,&#8221; &#8220;at,&#8221; etc. These words are frequently used but are often excluded during text analysis.</span></p>
